| Report of the Komagata Maru Committee of Inquiry and some further documents (with an introduction by Darshan S Tatla) | The Komagata Maru and the Ghadr Party are interconnected and illustrate major aspects of the early twentieth-century history that links India and Canada: the struggle for Indian independence, in which the North America-based Ghadr Party played a heroic though ill-planned and ill-timed role, and the campaign among Sikhs in Canada for full citizenship and for an end to Canadian regulations barring immigration from India. These regulations had been in force since 1908 and had buttressed the idea of Canada as a "white man's country." | India Komagata Maru Committee of Inquiry | 2007 |

| Hindustan Ghadar<br><br>Record Group 118, Office of the U.S. Attorney, San Francisco, Neutrality Case Files, 1913-1920  |  Starting on November 1, 1913, the Gadar party put out a weekly paper called Gadar, meaning revolt, using a small hand press. The paper first came out in Urdu, then Gurmukhi. Later, the paper was sometimes also published in Gujrati, Hindi, Pashto, Bengali, English, German, French and others. “No single society in India or even ten of them, published so many newspapers in various dialects, for in India or abroad no publishing house has, within the last four years, published so many and such excellent books which pierce the mind of masses and give them both enlightenment and enthusiasm, and which remain up to this day unanswered by the English Government,” wrote Ram Chandra.The office of the paper was known as the Yugantar Ashram, after Buddhist rest houses that provided shelter to the weary. In addition to the printing press, it also housed workers who worked at the Ashram and Indian visitors to San Francisco.|  | 1913-1920 |

| Selected Records Relating to the Indian (Hindu) Independence Movement in the United States <br><br> Follow the link -https://catalog.archives.gov/id/234401453 <br><br>The above record is preserved as a microfilm (National Archives Identifier -234401453; Other Identifier - M1868) at Marlyland National Archives. <br><br> Note: There are 3 files within this series which include further records of proceedings against "Hindu nationalists"  | During World War I, Hindu nationalists took advantage of Great Britain’s preoccupation with the European war by attempting to foment revolution in India to overthrow British rule. Their activities were aided politically and financially by the German Government. Hindu nationalists in the United States were active in the independence movement effort through fundraising, arms buying, and propagandizing through the Hindustan Ghadar newspaper published in San Francisco. The Department of Justice and U.S. Attorney records reproduced herein primarily concern the United States Government’s prosecution of these Hindu Nationalists in the “Hindu Conspiracy Case” for violations of the Espionage Act (40 Stat. 217-231) arising from two major incidents. In the first incident, the German Government provided funds with which the nationalists purchased arms for shipment to Indian rebels. The arms were shipped from San Francisco, California, on the Annie Larsen, which then sailed to Mexico where the arms were transferred to the Maverick, which then sailed to the East Indies. The British Government arrested some of the Maverick’s personnel in Singapore. In the second incident, several Indians (some of whom were U.S. citizens) and others were arrested for attempted fraud involved in soliciting funds for, and calling themselves representatives of, the “Nationalists Government” of India. In the spring of 1918, the “Hindu Conspiracy Case” trial (as it was called in the press and Department of Justice correspondence) was held in San Francisco, at which 29 people were convicted in indictments arising from the arms shipment. Indictments arising from the fraud case were dismissed. The Immigration and Naturalization Service records reproduced herein relate to efforts to revoke the citizenship of certain Indians naturalized as U.S. citizens, as well as to general efforts to exclude Indians from admission to the United States and Canada. | The Department of Justice and U.S. Attorney records | The creator compiled or maintained this series between 2000–2000.
