| Hindustan Ghadar<br><br>Record Group 118, Office of the U.S. Attorney, San Francisco, Neutrality Case Files, 1913-1920  |  Starting on November 1, 1913, the Gadar party put out a weekly paper called Gadar, meaning revolt, using a small hand press. The paper first came out in Urdu, then Gurmukhi. Later, the paper was sometimes also published in Gujrati, Hindi, Pashto, Bengali, English, German, French and others. “No single society in India or even ten of them, published so many newspapers in various dialects, for in India or abroad no publishing house has, within the last four years, published so many and such excellent books which pierce the mind of masses and give them both enlightenment and enthusiasm, and which remain up to this day unanswered by the English Government,” wrote Ram Chandra.The office of the paper was known as the Yugantar Ashram, after Buddhist rest houses that provided shelter to the weary. In addition to the printing press, it also housed workers who worked at the Ashram and Indian visitors to San Francisco.|  | 1913-1920 |

| Gadar Extracts | Record Group 21. US District Court, Northern District of California, San Francisco - On April 7, 1917, the morning after the United States declared war on Germany, federal agents arrested five Hindoos in San Francisco. These men had been under surveillance by detectives on the payroll of the British government. Now they were charged with conspiring with Germans to overthrow British rule in India. Three months later, they were five among the 105 Hindoos, Germans, and Americans indicted by a federal grand jury in San Francisco. Then in November the trial started in federal court, lasting five months. |  | |

| Selected Records Relating to the Indian (Hindu) Independence Movement in the United States <br><br> Follow the link -https://catalog.archives.gov/id/234401453 <br><br>The above record is preserved as a microfilm (National Archives Identifier -234401453; Other Identifier - M1868) at the SF National Archives. <br><br> Note: There are 3 files within this series which include further records of proceedings against "Hindu nationalists"  | During World War I, Hindu nationalists took advantage of Great Britain’s preoccupation with the European war by attempting to foment revolution in India to overthrow British rule. Their activities were aided politically and financially by the German Government. Hindu nationalists in the United States were active in the independence movement effort through fundraising, arms buying, and propagandizing through the Hindustan Ghadar newspaper published in San Francisco. The Department of Justice and U.S. Attorney records reproduced herein primarily concern the United States Government’s prosecution of these Hindu Nationalists in the “Hindu Conspiracy Case” for violations of the Espionage Act (40 Stat. 217-231) arising from two major incidents. In the first incident, the German Government provided funds with which the nationalists purchased arms for shipment to Indian rebels. The arms were shipped from San Francisco, California, on the Annie Larsen, which then sailed to Mexico where the arms were transferred to the Maverick, which then sailed to the East Indies. The British Government arrested some of the Maverick’s personnel in Singapore. In the second incident, several Indians (some of whom were U.S. citizens) and others were arrested for attempted fraud involved in soliciting funds for, and calling themselves representatives of, the “Nationalists Government” of India. In the spring of 1918, the “Hindu Conspiracy Case” trial (as it was called in the press and Department of Justice correspondence) was held in San Francisco, at which 29 people were convicted in indictments arising from the arms shipment. Indictments arising from the fraud case were dismissed. The Immigration and Naturalization Service records reproduced herein relate to efforts to revoke the citizenship of certain Indians naturalized as U.S. citizens, as well as to general efforts to exclude Indians from admission to the United States and Canada. | The Department of Justice and U.S. Attorney records | The creator compiled or maintained this series between 2000–2000. This series documents the time period of 1908–1933.<br><br> This series is avialble for unrestricted access online. |
