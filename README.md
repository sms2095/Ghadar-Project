| Hindustan Ghadar  | Record Group 118, Office of the U.S. Attorney, San Francisco, Neutrality Case Files, 1913-1920   -  Starting on November 1, 1913, the Gadar party put out a weekly paper called Gadar, meaning revolt, using a small hand press. The paper first came out in Urdu, then Gurmukhi. Later, the paper was sometimes also published in Gujrati, Hindi, Pashto, Bengali, English, German, French and others. “No single society in India or even ten of them, published so many newspapers in various dialects, for in India or abroad no publishing house has, within the last four years, published so many and such excellent books which pierce the mind of masses and give them both enlightenment and enthusiasm, and which remain up to this day unanswered by the English Government,” wrote Ram Chandra.The office of the paper was known as the Yugantar Ashram, after Buddhist rest houses that provided shelter to the weary. In addition to the printing press, it also housed workers who worked at the Ashram and Indian visitors to San Francisco.|  | 1913-1920 |
